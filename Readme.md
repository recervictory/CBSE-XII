XyleXylem tubes are made from dead cells that havjoined together. There is no cytoplasm in thescells. Xylem transports dissolved substances anthe water needed for photosynthesis upward tall parts of the plant. This movement of water icalled the transpiration stream.

In xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are interconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting channels reaching all parts of the plant. 
At the roots, cells in contact with the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the concentration of these ions between the root and the soil. This cause water moves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. 
The water which is lost through the stomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels in the leaf. 
Evaporation of water molecules from the cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water from the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the form of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is known as transpiration.
Transpiration helps in the absorption and upward movement of water and minerals dissolved in it from roots to the leaves.
The effect of root pressure in transport of water is more important at night. During the day when the stomata are open, the transpiration pull becomes the major driving force in the movement of water in the xylem.

Transport of food and other substances: 
Phloem tubes consist of living cells with small holes in the end walls, forming structures called sieve plates. These allow dissolved sugars produced during photosynthesis to pass through the cell walls. Substances move in both directions. This is called translocation.
Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem transports amino acids and other substances. These substances are
especially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and to growing organs. 
These substances are especially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and to growing organs. 
Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using energy from ATP. This increases the osmotic pressure of the tissue causing water to move into it
