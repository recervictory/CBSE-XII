        "In python, you can use binary files to not only data but also store the data structures (list or dictionary) also. This is particularly useful for storing python data structures as their original structures. To retrieve data structures from a binary file we need a special python module called `pickle`. By using word **`Pickling`** we refers to a process of covering the python data structure to byte stream before writing to a file. While reading the contents of the file, a reverse process called **`UnPickling`** is used to convert the byte stream to the original data structure.\n",
        "As we previously know that methods provided for reading/writing a file with `string` data types. So when we want to work with the binary file format, conversion of data at the time of reading/writing is required. Pickle module can be used to store any kind of object maintaining their original data structure format.\n",
