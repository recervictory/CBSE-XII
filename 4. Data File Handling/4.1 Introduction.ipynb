    "1. **Text Files**: A text files stores information in *ASCII or UniCode* characters. In the text files, each lines is terminated,(delimited) with a special characters known known as **EOF(End of Line)** character. In the text files, some internal translations take places when this EOL character is read or written. In Python, by default, this EOL character is newline character ('\\n') or carriage-return, newline combination('\\r\\n').\n",
    "2. **Binary Files**: A binary files is just that contains information in same format in which the information is held in memory. i.e., the files content that return to you is raw format (with no translations or specific encoding). In binary files, there is no delimited for lines. Also no translations occurs in binary files. As a result, binary files are faster and easier for a program to read and write in compare with a text files. As long as the people or need to be ported to different type of system, binary files are the best way to store program.\n",
